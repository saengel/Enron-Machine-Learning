# enron-machine-learning
After completing the Udacity "Introduction to Machine Learning Course" (which you can find here: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), I used their pre-written code to develop my own testing of four machine learning algorithms I studied in the course, to achieve an F1 score greater than 0.3. 

### Running the code
Everything here was prewritten code (or data) provided by the course, except for `final_project/poi_id.py` which is where I did the main developmnent to complete the project. To see my results, run that file using `python3`

###### Note:
The code was originally written in Python 2, I've made some small syntactical modifications to allow it to run in Python 3.9
