After completing the Udacity "Introduction to Machine Learning Course" (which you can find here: https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), I used their pre-written code to develop my own testing of four machine learning algorithms I studied in the course, to achieve an F1 score greater than 0.3.
